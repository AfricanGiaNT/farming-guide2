**Date:** 2025-01-09

## üéØ What I Built
I integrated the existing SQLite database containing 856 chunked agriculture guide PDFs into the crop recommendation system, replacing the static JSON-based recommendations with dynamic, location-specific advice from official Malawi agriculture guides. The system now queries real agriculture guides like the Malawi Maize Growers Guide, Groundnut Production Guide, and National Agriculture Extension Policy to provide farmers with expert-level recommendations based on actual agricultural expertise rather than generic crop data.

## ‚ö° The Problem
The crop recommendation system was using static JSON data that provided generic crop suggestions without the depth and specificity that farmers needed. The recommendations lacked real agricultural expertise, location-specific advice, and practical farming guidance from official sources. Farmers were receiving basic crop names and scores but missing crucial information like planting timing, management tips, risk assessments, and expert advice that could only come from actual agriculture guides and extension materials. The system needed to leverage the rich knowledge base already available in the SQLite database containing chunked PDFs from official Malawi agriculture guides.

## üîß My Solution
I implemented a comprehensive SQLite-based recommendation engine that queries agriculture guide PDFs for location-specific crop advice:

### **SQLite-Based Recommendation Engine**
- **Database Integration**: Queries `farming_guide_vectors.db` with 856 PDF chunks from official guides
- **Dynamic Search**: Generates location-specific search terms based on season, rainfall, and temperature
- **Content Extraction**: Extracts crop recommendations, planting advice, management tips, and risk assessments
- **Relevance Scoring**: Calculates content relevance based on location, season, and environmental conditions
- **Source Attribution**: Tracks which agriculture guides were used for each recommendation

### **Enhanced Response Formatting**
- **Guide-Based Recommendations**: Shows actual crop names from agriculture guides with suitability scores
- **Planting Advice**: Extracts timing and method recommendations from guide content
- **Management Tips**: Provides practical farming advice from expert sources
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies weather, pest, and disease risks from guide content
- **Source Transparency**: Displays which agriculture guides were consulted

### **AI Response Synthesizer Compatibility**
- **Dual Structure Support**: Handles both old JSON structure and new SQLite structure
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when AI enhancement fails
- **Content Adaptation**: Automatically adapts formatting for different data structures
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for both recommendation formats

### **Key Technical Features**
- **Vector Search Integration**: Uses existing FAISS vector database for semantic search

- **Location-Specific Queries**: Tailors search terms based on coordinates and conditions

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design

### **SQLite-Based Recommendation Engine Architecture**
The system uses a modular architecture that integrates with existing components:

```python
class SQLiteBasedRecommendationEngine:
    def __init__(self, db_path: str = "data/farming_guide_vectors.db"):
        self.db_path = db_path
        self.historical_api = HistoricalWeatherAPI()
    
    def get_crop_recommendations_from_guides(self, lat, lon, season, 
                                           rainfall_mm, temperature, historical_years=5):
        # Get historical weather data
        historical_data = self.historical_api.get_historical_rainfall(lat, lon, historical_years)
        
        # Query agriculture guides for crop information
        crop_guides = self._query_crop_guides(lat, lon, season, rainfall_mm, temperature)
        
        # Generate recommendations based on guide content
        recommendations = self._generate_guide_based_recommendations(
            crop_guides, lat, lon, season, rainfall_mm, temperature, historical_data
        )
        
        return recommendations
```

### **Content Query and Extraction System**
The engine implements sophisticated content processing:

```python
def _query_crop_guides(self, lat, lon, season, rainfall_mm, temperature):
    # Generate search terms based on conditions
    search_terms = self._generate_search_terms(season, rainfall_mm, temperature)
    
    # Query database for relevant content
    for term in search_terms:
        cursor.execute("""
            SELECT id, content, source, metadata
            FROM documents
            WHERE content LIKE ?
            ORDER BY id
            LIMIT 10
        """, (f'%{term}%',))
    
    # Calculate relevance and remove duplicates
    guide_content.sort(key=lambda x: x['relevance_score'], reverse=True)
    unique_content = self._remove_duplicate_content(guide_content)
    
    return unique_content
```

### **Response Formatting Integration**
The AI response synthesizer was updated to handle both data structures:

```python
def _format_basic_response(self, recommendations, weather_data, location, season_filter):
    # Handle both old JSON structure and new SQLite structure
    if 'crop_data' in rec:
        # Old JSON structure
        crop_name = crop_data.get('name', 'Unknown')
        score = rec.get('total_score', 0)
    else:
        # New SQLite structure
        crop_name = rec.get('crop_name', 'Unknown')
        suitability_score = rec.get('suitability_score', 0)
        score = suitability_score * 100  # Convert 0-1 to 0-100
    
    # Add guide sources for SQLite structure
    if 'crop_data' not in rec:
        guide_sources = rec.get('sources', [])
        if guide_sources:
            source_names = [source.split('.')[0] for source in guide_sources[:1]]
            response += f"   Source: {', '.join(source_names)}\n"
```

### **Database Query Optimization**
```python
def _generate_search_terms(self, season, rainfall_mm, temperature):
    terms = []
    
    # Season-based terms
    if season == 'rainy_season':
        terms.extend(['rainy season', 'wet season', 'rainfall', 'irrigation'])
    elif season == 'dry_season':
        terms.extend(['dry season', 'drought', 'water conservation', 'irrigation'])
    
    # Rainfall-based terms
    if rainfall_mm < 100:
        terms.extend(['drought tolerant', 'low rainfall', 'water efficient'])
    elif rainfall_mm > 500:
        terms.extend(['high rainfall', 'flood resistant', 'drainage'])
    
    # General crop terms
    terms.extend([
        'maize', 'corn', 'beans', 'groundnuts', 'peanuts', 'sorghum',
        'cassava', 'sweet potato', 'soybeans', 'pigeon peas',
        'planting', 'cultivation', 'production', 'yield',
        'Malawi', 'Lilongwe', 'agriculture', 'farming'
    ])
    
    return list(set(terms))  # Remove duplicates
```

### **Content Relevance Scoring**
```python
def _calculate_content_relevance(self, content, lat, lon, season, rainfall_mm, temperature):
    relevance = 0.0
    
    # Location relevance
    if 'Malawi' in content or 'Lilongwe' in content:
        relevance += 0.3
    
    # Season relevance
    if season == 'rainy_season' and ('rainy' in content.lower() or 'wet' in content.lower()):
        relevance += 0.2
    elif season == 'dry_season' and ('dry' in content.lower() or 'drought' in content.lower()):
        relevance += 0.2
    
    # Crop relevance
    crop_terms = ['maize', 'beans', 'groundnuts', 'cassava', 'sweet potato', 'sorghum']
    for crop in crop_terms:
        if crop in content.lower():
            relevance += 0.1
    
    return min(1.0, relevance)
```
