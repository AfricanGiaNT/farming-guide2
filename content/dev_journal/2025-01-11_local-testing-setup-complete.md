## My Solution

### **1. Layered Setup Architecture**
```
Configuration Check â†’ Knowledge Base Setup â†’ Local Demo â†’ Production Deployment
```

Each layer validates the previous one and provides clear next steps, ensuring users can't get stuck.

### **2. Intelligent Configuration Management**
```python
def check_configuration():
    config_status = {
        "telegram_bot_token": False,
        "openweathermap_api_key": False,
        "openai_api_key": False,
        "database_configured": False,
        "directories_created": False
    }
    # Comprehensive validation with helpful feedback
```

### **3. Interactive Knowledge Base Setup**
```python
def add_pdfs_to_knowledge_base(self, pdf_directory: str = "data/pdfs"):
    # Automated PDF discovery and processing
    # Real-time status reporting
    # Performance monitoring
    # Error handling with clear solutions
```

### **4. Comprehensive Demo System**
```python
def demo_enhanced_recommendations(self):
    # Live demonstration of 10-factor scoring
    # Confidence assessment showcase
    # Planting calendar integration
    # PDF-enhanced variety recommendations
```
